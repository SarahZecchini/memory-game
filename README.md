### Instructions

* GOAL - Match all cards until there are not matches left. You can earn a maximum of 3 Gold stars

* TO PLAY - Click on any card to initiate the game and timer. Then click another card to see if they match. If they do, success! They will stay up and you can move on to finding the next pair. If the do not match, they will both flip over and you will need to continue searching for matches.

* The game is over when you have successfully matched all cards on the board.

### Approach

This was a very difficult project for me. I started by reviewing all requirements and the style guides. I wrote out a list of every thing I knew I needed to do, for example
  * Flip cards
  * Begin Timer
  * Create modal

This helped me to begin to visualize what I needed to do. I then drew out the flow of the game play, to help solidify what those list items needed.

I found that no matter how much I wrote out or felt I understood, as soon as I sat down to begin coding, I just didn't know where to start.

I watched several overviews, including the 2 videos posted by Udacity members. I hung out in Slack and asked questions, and sought to learn how others were tackling their issues.

I built a list of resources by scouring MDN and Slack, and spent a good time googling.

In the end, I determined to break each action into small chunks. To ignore the HTML and CSS until I had the groundwork built in JS, and then begin to sew them together.

### Version Control

I wanted to ensure that I started my first project since learning about Git made most of that practice. My local Git had been properly set up in previous lessons. Because I am still learning and wanted to focus on the code itself, I opted to streamline my committal process but downloading the Git and GitHub Packages thru Atom so I could Stage, Commit and Push to GitHub in a matter of moments.

I admit, I ended up taking a bit of time to get it to actually work...but when I finally got it properly set up it helped with the process and I learned a lot as well.
